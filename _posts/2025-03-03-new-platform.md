After years of maintaining a WordPress blog and paying monthly hosting fees, I decided it was time for a change. Moving to GitHub Pages has been both a cost-effective decision and an engaging technical project.

The main benefits I've found:

- **Zero hosting costs**: GitHub Pages is completely free for personal sites
- **Simple workflow**: Writing posts in Markdown is straightforward and clean
- **Version control**: Everything is in Git, making changes and rollbacks easy
- **Learning opportunity**: Building the site gave me hands-on experience with Jekyll

While WordPress served me well, this transition has been refreshing. The simplicity of static site generation combined with free hosting makes GitHub Pages an excellent platform for developer blogs.
